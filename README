File Tree Word Frequency Analyzer

DESCRIPTION & USAGE

   A small threaded program to tabulate word frequency across a set of
   files of type TYPE in the file tree specified by PATH. Capable of
   searching for multiple TYPES across multiple PATHS. By default,
   uses one thread per requested search PATH and a number of worker
   threads matched to your system's concurrency capabilities. By
   default, the 10 most frequent words and their counts are
   displayed. The program is also capable of displaying the least
   frequent words. All these options can be controlled via the Options
   listed below.

   Usage:
     ./wordfreq [OPTION]... [PATH]...
   Counts word frequency in files of TYPE within PATH
   Options:
     -h [ --help ]               : produce help message
     -t [ --file-types ] arg     : comma-separated list of file extensions to scan
                                   ('.' for no extension) (DEFAULT: 'txt')
     -m [ --most ] arg           : list the N most common words (DEFAULT: '10')
     -l [ --least ] arg          : list the N least common words (DEFAULT: '0')
     -w [ --worker-threads ] arg : use N worker-threads to process files
                                   (DEFAULT: <System Specific>)
